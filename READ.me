Description of the Code:The provided Python script is designed to crawl a website after first checking and respecting the directives specified in its robots.txt file. Here’s a breakdown of its functionality and purpose:Fetching robots.txt:The script starts by requesting and retrieving the robots.txt file for a specified website URL using the fetch_robots_txt function. This file contains rules that dictate which parts of the website are allowed or disallowed for crawling by automated agents.Parsing robots.txt:Once fetched, the script parses the robots.txt content using the parse_robots_txt function. It organizes the rules into structured data, separating directives for different user agents (*, specific bots like magpie-crawler, CCBot, etc.).Checking Scraping Permissions:The check_scraping_permission function examines the parsed rules to determine if scraping (automated data collection) is permitted for the specified website URL. It checks against rules for the default user agent (*) and provides feedback based on whether scraping is allowed or disallowed.Crawling the Website:If scraping is permitted based on the robots.txt rules, the script proceeds to crawl the website. It begins from the provided base URL and recursively follows links found on each page.During crawling (crawl_website function), the script respects Disallow directives from robots.txt. It skips URLs that match disallowed paths to ensure compliance with the website’s guidelines and to avoid accessing restricted content.Output and Interaction:Throughout execution, the script provides informative output:It displays parsed rules from robots.txt, showing which paths are disallowed and any special directives like Sitemap URLs.It logs URLs that are allowed for crawling and those that are skipped due to Disallow rules.Finally, it summarizes the total number of unique pages successfully crawled from the website.Respectful Crawling Practices:The script includes a delay between requests (time.sleep(1)) to adhere to respectful crawling practices. This prevents overwhelming the server with rapid requests and ensures that the script operates within reasonable resource limits.Usage and Application:Users can interact with the script by providing a website URL. It then fetches robots.txt, checks permissions, and crawls the site accordingly, demonstrating effective handling of web crawling tasks while adhering to specified rules.This script is valuable for developers and data analysts who need to gather information from websites while maintaining compliance with web standards and respect for site policies. It showcases best practices for web scraping and demonstrates how to integrate robots.txt compliance into automated data collection workflows.
